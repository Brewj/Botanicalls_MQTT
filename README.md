# Botanicalls_MQTT
Botanicalls as a MQTT device

This was a little project to get my Botanicalls Kit https://www.botanicalls.com to send it's readings out via MQTT

I got my Botanicalls board years ago, it was a great project to make but I never really mastered getting it to push correctly to Twitter.

What I wanted to be able to do is use this super kit to output data via MQTT so I can absorb it into my other IoT home automaiton projects in my house.
